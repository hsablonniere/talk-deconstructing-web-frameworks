** Sebastian Markbåge sur Twitter : \"You may have noticed that most other frameworks don’t have HoCs, render props or anything like React.Children.

* https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/1101690609457258496
** Sebastian Markbåge sur Twitter : \"React has lazy evaluation for components. It comes with some overhead but gives us things like suspense, memoization, time slicing, parallelization among children, lazy computation. Hooks are eager and will undo all of those benefits.\"

* https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/1106754371226763264
** Sebastian Markbåge sur Twitter : \"I don't think React has become popular because it's more \"intuitive\" to people. It's not an iPad that toddlers just naturally interact with.

* https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/1100246591544254465
** Alex Russell sur Twitter : \"I'm anti-wrong-tools-for-the-job. Most often, the correct choice is appropriate framework vs. inappropriate, not some vs. none.That might leave your favourite tool in the cold, but you can't say it's \"anti-framework\". Not by a long shot.… https://t.co/zTjXNOYHiq\"

** Tom Dale sur Twitter : \"The example code on https://t.co/glnWl886Ok no longer works in Chrome because it uses an older version of Polymer. Works in Safari. The irony is so thick you could drizzle it over pancakes. If you're gonna Use the Platform, make sure that Platform is nailed down to something!\"

** Jake Archibald sur Twitter : \"I feel like CSS modules are overlooked in the whole CSS vs JS debate.➡️ You write .css files➡️ Can use preprocessors like Sass➡️ Encourages flatter CSS (like BEM and similar conventions)➡️ But you can still use the cascade➡️ Unique class names➡️ Tree-shaking➡️ .css output\"

* https://twitter.com/samccone/status/1081258888698068995
** Sam Saccone sur Twitter : \"Last evening I saw a demo of a SSR @angular app that had partial client-side component hydration triggered only by a mutating user action.This meant that not only was there 0 JS overhead to render the app, but that users only paid the runtime cost for what they interacted with\"

** Francisco Tolmasky sur Twitter : \"Tree-shaking could be an anti-optimization. The ideal is for your libraries, which change less often than your app code, to be codesplit separately & be barely tree-shaken if at all, so that updates to your app result in unchanged library “chunks” and minimal cache busting (1/x)\"
